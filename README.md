# Fashion_MNIST

The Fashion MNIST was originally brought up as to provide a more sophisticated and complicated replacement for NIST. 

The biggest error occurs when shirt, T-shirt, coat and pullover are misidentified. This is as expected since they looks very alike. To speed up the runing time, one can consider working on a subset of the entire dataset, which includes shirt, t-shirt, coat and pullover and work out a better algorithm.
