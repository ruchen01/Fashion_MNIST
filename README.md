# Fashion_MNIST

The Fashion MNIST was originally brought up as to provide a more sophisticated and complicated replacement for NIST. 

Here I show how the accuray can be improved gradually by 1. Logistic regression (a super shallow neural networks) 2. Neural networks. 3. Convolutional neural networks 4. ResNet. 

The final result shows the biggest error occurs when shirt, T-shirt, coat and pullover are misidentified. This is as expected since they looks very alike. To speed up the runing time, one can consider working on a subset of the entire dataset, which includes shirt, t-shirt, coat and pullover and work out a better algorithm.
